# üçµ , Hanji Kaise ho aap sabhi this is 12th day of #100Days_Of_Python I'm back and ready to code.let's start to do code.

# ===================== Scope, Namespace and etc ===================== #

#  think in our house we have tree of apple who can acess the apple obviously our family memeber and think tree on road then who can access those apple, anyone write. like that we can visuvalize tree as a variable and apple as a value of varabile and home or road is scope of variable.
